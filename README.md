# Calculator
I created this calculator in my free time
to reinforce the concepts of object-oriented programming. The calculator does basic arithmitic like addition,subtravtion,multiplication, 
and division. In the code you'll see examples of how numbers and operators should be written. I plan to create a parser to check if the user input is in this correct order.
